# Accounting Service Reference Card

* Daemons running
  * httpd
  * crond
  * atd
  * apeldbloader-cloud

* Init commands (services started on container creation)
  * service httpd start
  * service crond start
  * service atd start
  * service apeldbloader-cloud start

* Configuration file locations
  * /etc/httpd/conf.d/apel_rest_api.conf - forces SSL.
  * /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf - configures SSL.
  * /etc/apel/cloudloader.cfg - configuration for the loader.
  * /etc/apel/cloudsummariser.cfg - configuration for the summariser.

* Logfile locations
  * /var/log/cloud/loader.log - log file for the loader.
  * /var/log/cloud/summariser.log - log file for the summariser.

* Open ports
  * 80 - all traffic to this port is forwarded to port 443 by the Apache server.
  * 443 - the Apache server forwards (HTTPS) traffic to the APEL server, which returns a Django view for recognised URL patterns.
  * 3306 - used by the APEL server service and the MySQL service to communicate with each other.

* Possible unit test of the service
  * Continuous integration tests conducted during development via [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/apel/rest).
  * For end to end testing, data could be POSTED to the endpoint, summarised and then retrieved from the GET endpoint.

* Where is service state held (and can it be rebuilt)
  * Service is deployed in a docker container, do not rebuild released docker containers without incrementing package information in version, i.e 1.1.0-1 => 1.1.0-2

* Cron jobs
  * /etc/cron.d/cloudsummariser - runs the summariser.
  * /etc/cron.d/IGTF-bundle-update - updates the IGTF bundle on the first day of the month.

* Security information
  * Access control Mechanism description (authentication & authorization)
    * X.509 certificates for POST requests
    * IAM tokens for GET requests
  
  * How to block/ban a user
    * To ban users accessing summaries, remove them from `ALLOWED_FOR_GET` in `/var/www/html/apel_rest/settings.py`.
    * To ban users sending job records, perhaps because a provider in the Indigo provider list is negatively effecting
      the quality of the service for users by bulk reppublishing, add their HostDN to `BANNED_FROM_POST` in `/var/www/html/apel_rest/settings.py`.
    * Additional users, not on the providers list, can also be granted POST rights, by adding their HostDN to `ALLOWED_TO_POST` in `/var/www/html/apel_rest/settings.py`.
    * Any changes to `/var/www/html/apel_rest/settings.py` require a `service httpd restart` to take effect.
 
  * Network Usage
    * Managed by the Kubernetes cluster.
  
  * Firewall configuration
    * Managed by the Kubernetes cluster.
    
  * Security recommendations
    * Do not use a self signed certifcate in production.
