# Accounting Service Reference Card
The Accounting service is made up of three containers
* APEL REST Interface
* APEL Server
* MySQL Database ([Standard MySQL:5.6 image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/))

## Daemons running
### APEL REST Interface
* httpd
* crond
* atd

### APEL Server 
* apeldbloader-cloud
* crond

## Init commands (services started on container creation)
### APEL REST Interface
* service httpd start
* service crond start
* service atd start

### APEL Server
 * service apeldbloader-cloud start
 * service crond start

## Configuration file locations
### APEL REST Interface
* /etc/httpd/conf.d/apel_rest_api.conf - forces SSL.
* /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf - configures SSL.

### APEL Server
* /etc/apel/cloudloader.cfg - configuration for the loader.
* /etc/apel/cloudsummariser.cfg - configuration for the summariser.

## Logfile locations
### APEL REST Interface
* /var/log/httpd/error_log - the log file for the Django interface. All such messages get captured by the Apache server and are treated as errors

### APEL Server
* /var/log/cloud/loader.log - log file for the loader.
* /var/log/cloud/summariser.log - log file for the summariser.

## Open ports
* 80 - all traffic to this port is forwarded to port 443 by the Apache server.
* 443 - the Apache server forwards (HTTPS) traffic to the APEL server, which returns a Django view for recognised URL patterns.
* 3306 - used by the APEL server service and the MySQL service to communicate with each other.

## Possible unit test of the service
* Continuous integration tests conducted during development via [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/apel/rest).
* For end to end testing, data could be POSTED to the endpoint, summarised and then retrieved from the GET endpoint.

## Where is service state held (and can it be rebuilt)
* Service is deployed in a docker container, do not rebuild released docker containers without incrementing package information in version, i.e 1.1.0-1 => 1.1.0-2

## Cron jobs
### APEL REST Interface
* /etc/cron.d/cloudsummariser - runs the summariser.

### APEL Server
* /etc/cron.d/IGTF-bundle-update - updates the IGTF bundle on the first day of the month.
* /etc/cron.d/fetch-crl - updates the Certificate Revocation Lists every 6 hours

## Security information
The APEL REST Interface container is the only container with a public endpoint, as such it deals with authentication & authorization.
### Access control Mechanism description (authentication & authorization)
* X.509 certificates for POST requests
* IAM tokens for GET requests
  
### How to block/ban a user
* To ban users accessing summaries, remove them from `ALLOWED_FOR_GET` in `/var/www/html/yaml/apel_rest_interface.env`.
* To ban users sending job records, perhaps because a provider in the Indigo provider list is negatively effecting the quality of the service for users by bulk reppublishing, add their HostDN to `BANNED_FROM_POST` in `/var/www/html/yaml/apel_rest_interface.env`.
* Additional users, not on the providers list, can also be granted POST rights, by adding their HostDN to `ALLOWED_TO_POST` in `/var/www/html/yaml/apel_rest_interface.env`.
* Any changes to `/var/www/html/yaml/apel_rest_interface.env` require a container restart to take effect.
 
## Network Usage
* Managed by the Kubernetes cluster.
  
## Firewall configuration
* Managed by the Kubernetes cluster.
    
## Security recommendations
* Do not use a self signed certifcate in production.
