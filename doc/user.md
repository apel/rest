# Using the APEL Accounting REST Interface

## As a Provider

Providers can publish accounting records to the endpoint:

`.../api/v1/cloud/record`

To do this, Providers must be running OpenStack or OpenNebula and install the appropriate collectors. Links to these can be found at [List of Artifacts](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/indigo-datacloud-releases/content/indigo1/accounting1.html)

Records can be sent to the REST interface using this [script](scripts/sender.py). Run `python sender.py -h` for a list of options that need to be set in order to send.

### Expected Responses
* 202: The data has been successfully saved for future loading and summarising.
* 401: An X.509 certifcate was not provided by the request, your data was not saved.
* 403: An X.509 certifcate was provided, but it was not authorised to publish, your data was not saved.
* 500: An unknown error has a occured, your data was not saved.

## As a Member of Indigo DataCloud

Micro services can retrieve accounting summaries from the endpoint.

`.../api/v1/cloud/record/summary`

The query space is limited by key=value pairs after a "?" seperated by "&".

For Example:

`.../api/v1/cloud/record/summary?service="service_name"&from="YYYYMMDD"`

### Supported key=value pairs

* `group`: The group within Indigo DataCloud.
* `service`: The site that provided the resource.
* `user`: The global user name of the resource submitter.
* `to`: Display summaries for dates (YYYYMMDD) up until this value, but exclusive of it.
* `from`: Display summaries for dates (YYYYMMDD) after this value, but exclusive of it.

`from` is the only compulsary option, failure to include it will result in a 400 response.

Currently, only one of `user`, `group` or `service` can be set in the same query. Combining more than one will result in a 400 response.

### Expected Status Codes
* 200: Your request was succesfully met.
* 400: No key=value pair provided for `from`, or more than one of `user`, `group` or `service` is set.
* 401: Your service's OAuth token was not provided by the request, or was not successfully extracted by the server.
* 403: Your service's OAuth token was extracted by the server, but the IAM does not recognise it.
* 500: An unknown error has a occured.
